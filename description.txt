All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

Using the prototype Property:
The JavaScript prototype property allows you to add new properties to object constructors.
