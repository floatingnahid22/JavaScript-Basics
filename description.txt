All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

JavaScript Primitives:
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods. 3.14 is a primitive value. A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.
JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:
1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. null
5. undefined
6. symbol
7. bigint

Object Properties:
The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.

Object Methods:
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions. An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods.

Creating a JavaScript Object
With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.

There are different ways to create new objects:
1. Create a single object, using an object literal.
2. Create a single object, with the keyword new.
3. Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
4. Create an object using Object.create().
